# Spam Detection using Machine Learning

A machine learning project that classifies emails/SMS messages as Spam or Ham (Not Spam) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and multiple classification algorithms.

---

## Project Overview

Spam detection is one of the classic applications of Machine Learning. In this project, raw text messages are cleaned, transformed into numerical features using TF-IDF Vectorization, and classified using multiple ML models. The models are then compared based on Precision, Recall, and F1 Score to find the best performer.

## Text Preprocessing Steps

1. Lowercasing — Convert all text to lowercase
2. Remove Special Characters — Strip out symbols and punctuation
3. Tokenization — Split text into individual words
4. Remove Stop Words — Remove common words like "the", "is", "a"
5. Stemming — Reduce words to their root form (e.g. "running" to "run")
